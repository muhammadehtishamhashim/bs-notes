# Finite Automata (FA)

A **Finite Automaton** is a mathematical model used to recognize patterns in sequences of input symbols. It constitutes a system with a finite amount of memory.

## Key Features
* **Finite States:** The system exists in one of a finite set of states at any given time.
* **Transitions:** Movement between states occurs based on the **current state** and the **input symbol**.
* **Memory:** Limited memory, encapsulated entirely by the current state.
* **Acceptance:** If the automaton ends in an "accepting state" after processing the entire string, the string is accepted.

## Operations
1.  **Read Input:** Processes symbols one by one from left to right.
2.  **Change State:** Updates status based on transition rules.
3.  **Output Decision:** Returns "Yes" (Accept) or "No" (Reject) based on the final state.

## Applications
* **Lexical Analysis:** Identifying tokens (keywords, variables) in programming languages.
* **Pattern Matching:** Search engines and text editors.
* **Circuit Design:** Modeling synchronous sequential circuits.
* **Protocol Modeling:** Verifying states in network handshakes (e.g., TCP connection).
