# Introduction to Theory of Automata

**Automata Theory** is the study of abstract machines and automata, as well as the computational problems that can be solved using them.

## Core Concepts
* **Abstract Machines:** Mathematical models used to solve problems (e.g., Finite Automata, Turing Machines).
* **Pattern Recognition:** The primary capability of automata is recognizing patterns within input data.
* **Computation:** Understanding what can be computed and how efficiently.

## Why Study Automata?
* **Compiler Design:** Used for lexical analysis (scanning) and parsing.
* **Text Processing:** Basis for Regular Expressions (Regex) and string matching algorithms.
* **Protocol Verification:** Modeling communication protocols to ensure correctness.
* **Hardware Design:** Designing and analyzing digital circuits and sequential logic.
