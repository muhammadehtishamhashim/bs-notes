title: The Role of Context
description: Why the same bits mean different things in different files.

## "Information = Bits + Context"

If you open the memory of a computer and look at a sequence of bits (e.g., `01000001`), strictly speaking, it is just a number. It has no inherent meaning until we apply **context**.

Context is provided by:

1. The file extension (telling the OS how to open it).
2. The file header (internal metadata).
3. The program reading the data.

## Example: The Same Sequence

Imagine we have the binary sequence for the decimal number **65** (`01000001`).

### 1. In a Text File (.txt)

If this byte is inside `hello.txt`, the text editor looks at the context (ASCII/UTF-8 encoding) and renders the letter:

> **A**

### 2. In an Image File (.jpg or .bmp)

If this byte is inside an image file, it might represent a color value. For example, it could be the "Red" channel intensity of a single pixel:

> **Red Value: 65 (Dark Red)**

### 3. In a Machine Code File (.exe)

If this byte is fed directly to the CPU as an instruction (in x86 architecture), `0x41` stands for:

> **INC ECX** (Increment the ECX register by 1)

## Summary Table

| Context (File Type) | Data Interpretation | Result | 
| :--- | :--- | :--- | 
| **Source Code (.c, .cpp)** | Text Characters | `int main() { ... }` | 
| **Executable (.exe)** | Machine Instructions | CPU performs addition/movement | 
| **Image (.png)** | Pixel Data | Colors on screen | 
| **Audio (.mp3)** | Sound Waves | Music/Voice | 

> **Takeaway:** The hardware stores the bits, but the software provides the context. Without context, data is meaningless.
