## Course Definition

**Computer Organization and Assembly Language (COAL)** is the study of the internal working, structuring, and implementation of a computer system. 

While *Computer Architecture* describes **what** the computer does (the attributes visible to the programmer), *Computer Organization* describes **how** it does it (the operational units and their interconnections).

### Core Concept: Information is Bits + Context
A computer system is fundamentally a machine that processes information. All information in a system is represented as a sequence of bits, but the **context** (how we interpret those bits) determines their meaning.

## Computer vs. Computer System

It is important to distinguish between the machine itself and the complete system.

| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Computer** | An electronic device capable of performing computations and making logical decisions at high speeds. It processes data into information. |
| **Computer System** | A complete, functional environment that includes the hardware, software, data, and users working together to achieve a specific goal. |

## System Components

A computer system consists of two primary layers:

### 1. Hardware Components
These are the physical, tangible parts of the system.
* **Processor (CPU):** The brain of the computer (Control Unit + ALU).
* **Main Memory (RAM):** Temporary storage for currently executing programs.
* **I/O Modules:** Interfaces for moving data between the computer and external environments (Disk drives, Terminals).
* **System Bus:** The communication pathway connecting the CPU, Memory, and I/O.

### 2. Software Components
These are the instructions and data that tell the hardware what to do.
* **System Software:** Manages the computer's resources (e.g., Operating System, Drivers).
* **Application Software:** Performs specific tasks for the user (e.g., Word processors, Web browsers).
